This app is useful for any teacher who needs a seating plan made with a focus on separiting disruptive children from each other.
### How do I get set up? ###

To set up this app in its current state you will need the latest version of visual studio and Windows 10
Simply clone or download the repository and run in visual studio.

### Current State ###
The app currently works for the most part. I still need to do some testing and a few things need fixing.
